CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. Typically a file is made with a .css extension that has all the CSS formating for your entire website of portentailly hundreds of pages. Example: make the colours red and green at xMass and all pink for Valentines day. <br><br>

You can also use CSS in the Style part of any webpage that defines the colours etc, for that entire webpage.<br><br>

Mr. Ellis teaches "inline CSS" the most powerful type. Every web page tag can have a CSS style to control it.<br><br>

<b > This is not that cool </b><br>
<b style="color:red; background:green"> This is cool </b><br><br>

Since CSS is cool what is the entire list of things we can do?
